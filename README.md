# ‚ôüÔ∏è Othello-AI-Minimax-Expectimax

A full implementation of the **Othello (Reversi)** board game in Python, featuring multiple sophisticated **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** agents.

---

## ‚ú® AI Algorithms & Game Features

* **Minimax & Alpha-Beta Pruning:** Core search algorithm optimized for reduced search space and increased depth.
* **Expectimax:** AI agent designed for non-deterministic environments or randomized opponents.
* **MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search):** Advanced probabilistic search agent for robust decision-making.
* **Evaluation Function:** Custom heuristic for board state evaluation, heavily weighting **Corners**, **Mobility**, and **Sides**.
* **GUI:** Built with **Pygame** for visual gameplay (Human vs. AI, AI vs. AI).
